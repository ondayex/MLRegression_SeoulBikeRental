# Seasonal Bike Rental Analysis

## Project Objective:
To build a simple web application using **ML Regression Models** that will allow users to explore data through a user-friendly interface and answer business-related questions.

## Business Problem
This project aims to optimize bike rental operations in Seoul by leveraging data-driven insights. By analyzing various factors affecting bike rentals, we can improve resource allocation, enhance user experience, and potentially increase revenue for the bike rental service. The original dataset has the following information:

RangeIndex: 8760 entries, 0 to 8759

dtypes: float64(6), int64(4), object(4)

Data columns (total 14 columns):

| 11 | Seasons                       | 8760 non-null  | object  |
| 12 | Holiday                       | 8760 non-null  | object  |
| 13 | Functioning Day               | 8760 non-null  | object  |

## Project Objectives
+ Identify and quantify the top 3-5 factors influencing bike rental demand in Seoul, providing actionable insights for operational decision-making.
+ Develop a regression model to predict hourly bike rental demand with at least 85% accuracy.
+ Design and deploy an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to test the regression model through an intuitive interface.

## Specific Questions/Insights Provided
+ What are the most significant factors influencing bike rental demand in Seoul?
+ How do seasonal changes and weather conditions impact bike rental patterns?
+ Are there any trends or patterns in bike rental usage during holidays or specific hours of the day?
+ How does air quality (visibility) affect bike rental behavior?

## Value Generation for the Organization
+ Efficient Bike Distribution: Enabling more efficient bike distribution across the city based on predicted demand.
+ Marketing Strategies: Informing marketing strategies to boost rentals during typically low-usage times.
+ Financial Planning: Assisting in budget allocation and financial planning based on expected rental patterns.
+ Customer Satisfaction: Improving customer satisfaction by ensuring bike availability during high-demand periods.

## Project Scope
+ Data Formatting and Exploration: Initial formatting and exploratory data analysis.
+ ML Model Development: Building a machine learning model to predict bike rental demand (Regression model).
+ Deployment: Deploying the model using a cloud service (AWS/GCP).
+ Web Application: Developing a Streamlit web app for external users to interact with the model.

# Project Phases
### Phase One
+ Data Acquisition: Gathering relevant datasets for analysis.
+ Data Exploration: Analyzing data to understand its structure and key characteristics.
+ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Preparing the data for modeling by handling missing values, outliers, etc.

### Phase Two
+ Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
+ Model Building & Selection: Developing and selecting the best regression model for predicting bike rental demand.
+ Model Evaluation & Training: Evaluating model performance and fine-tuning as necessary.

### Phase Three
+ Streamlit App GUI: Designing the graphical user interface for the web application.
+ Deployment: Deploying the web application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS/GCP) for public use.
